# PlanIt 
<p> At Planit, we believe that event planning should be a collaborative effort, and our website reflects that. We understand that everyone has different preferences and opinions when it comes to planning events, which is why we prioritize communication and collaboration on our platform. Our goal is to help you plan an event that everyone will enjoy and remember for years to come. </p>
